# Dimensionality Reduction

Question 1. [E] Why do we need dimensionality reduction?

Question 2. [E] Eigendecomposition is a common factorization technique used for dimensionality reduction. Is the eigendecomposition of a matrix always unique?

Question 3. [M] Name some applications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Question 4. [M] We want to do PCA on a dataset with multiple features in different ranges. For example, one feature is in the range 0-1 and another is in the range 10-1000. Will PCA work on this dataset?

Question 5. [H] Under what conditions can one apply eigendecomposition? What about SVD?

   i. What is the relationship between SVD and eigendecomposition?

   ii. What's the relationship between PCA and SVD?

Question 6. [H] How does t-SNE (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) work? Why do we need it?
