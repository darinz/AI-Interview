1. Dot product

    i. [E] Whatâ€™s the geometric interpretation of the dot product of two vectors?
    
    ii. [E] Given a vector $u$, find vector $v$ of unit length such that the dot product of $u$ and $v$ is maximum.

2. Outer product
   
   i. [E] Given two vectors $a = [3, 2, 1]$ and $b = [-1, 0, 1]$. Calculate the outer product $a^T b$?
   
   ii. [M] Give an example of how the outer product can be useful in ML.

3. [E] What does it mean for two vectors to be linearly independent?

4. [M] Given two sets of vectors $A = a_1, a_2, a_3, \cdots , a_n$ and $B = b_1, b_2, b_3, \cdots , b_m$. How do you check that they share the same basis?

5. [M] Given $n$ vectors, each of $d$ dimensions. What is the dimension of their span?

6. Norms and metrics
   
   i. [E] What's a norm? What are $L_0, L_1, L_2, L_{\infty}$ norms?
   
   ii. [M] How do norm and metric differ? Given a norm, make a metric. Given a metric, can we make a norm?
